Show me a sign, show me a reason to give
A solitary fuck about your god damn beliefs
I'm going blind, but one thing's clear
Death is the only salvation you'll fear
Brick by brick by brick
Brick by brick by brick
What you call faith, I call a sorry excuse
Cloak and daggers murder the truth
The bitter taste, there's nothing else
I'll bow for your king when he shows himself
Brick by brick by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Whispers in a thousand tongues
